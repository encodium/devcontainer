## Available MCP Servers

### AWS (`project-0-workspace-aws`)
Use for AWS infrastructure queries and operations.

**Defaults:**
- Region: `us-east-1` (this is default, only include `--region <REGION>` if different region needed)
- Always include `--profile <environment>` flag

**Profiles:**
- `staging` - Staging environment (safe for read operations)
- `production` - Production environment (require explicit user approval for any operation)
- `localstack` - Not on AWS. Local development container running Localstack. Use this if user is developing software that depends on AWS unless it's obvious they want real, remote data.

**Common operations:**
- EC2: `aws ec2 describe-instances --profile staging --region us-east-1`
- S3: `aws s3 ls --profile staging --region us-east-1`

**Authentication:**
If you receive SSO token errors, instruct the user to run:
```bash
aws sso login
```

**Caution:**
- Never run commands that would alter remote infrastructure
- Avoid commands that alter localstack intrastructure without user permission

### GitHub (`project-0-workspace-github`)
Use for repository operations, PR reviews, and issue management.

**Organization:** encodium

**Common tools:**
- `get_pull_request` - Get PR details (owner, repo, pull_number)
- `get_pull_request_files` - Get changed files in a PR
- `get_pull_request_reviews` - Get review comments
- `create_pull_request` - Create a new pull request

### MySQL (`project-0-workspace-mysql`)
Use for database queries during debugging or data exploration.

**Caution:**
- Prefer application code/repositories over direct DB queries for features
- Never run mutations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) without explicit user approval
- Always use LIMIT on SELECT queries for large tables

### Jira (`project-0-workspace-jira`)
Use for issue tracking and project management.

**Common tools:**
- `getJiraIssue` - Fetch issue details
- `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` - Search with JQL
- `addCommentToJiraIssue` - Add comments

## MCP Troubleshooting

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| SSO Token does not exist | User needs to run `aws sso login` |
| UnauthorizedOperation | Wrong profile or missing permissions - confirm profile with user |
| Tool not found | Check MCP server is enabled in mcp.json |
| Empty results | Check region, filters, or tag names with user |
